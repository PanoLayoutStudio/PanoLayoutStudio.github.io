Seg2Reg Documentation
===================================

**Seg2Reg** is a state-of-the-art single-view 360â—¦ room layout reconstruction methods, 
which render 1D layout depth regression from the 2D segmentation map in a 
differentiable and occlusion-aware way, marrying the merits of both formulations and 
resulting in a smaller yet stronger model.

**PanoLayoutStudio** is a codebase  implements various modern backbones and training 
techniques,aim to establishing a stronger baseline for fair comparisons and providing 
a resource for future works to reuse or recombine various components.
