Seg2Reg Documentation
===================================

State-of-the-art single-view 360â—¦ room layout reconstruction methods formulate the problem 
as a high-level 1D (per-column) regression task. We present Seg2Reg to render 1D layout depth 
regression from the 2D segmentation map in a differentiable and occlusion-aware way, marrying 
the merits of both sides.
